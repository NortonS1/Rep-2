# How to: Heatmap

First, load the file and packages 
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
setwd("~/Desktop/R work/FlowCore")
read.csv("N Concatflow.csv") -> x
library(ComplexHeatmap)
library(dendextend)
```
Next, scale the data by columns (log transformed)
```{r, warning = FALSE}
as.matrix(x) -> Xm
log10(Xm) -> Xl
Xl[!rowSums(!is.finite(Xl)),] -> Xl
apply(Xl,2,scale) -> Xs
```
Now set up your colour palette
```{r}
My_Palette <- colorRampPalette(c("navy","aliceblue","bisque","chocolate1","firebrick"))(256)
```
**Finally, run the heatmap**
```{r, fig.cap="Single Cell analysis of Macrophage populations in NTB tissue", fig.align = "center"}
Heatmap(Xs, cluster_columns = FALSE, col = My_Palette, row_dend_width = unit(3,"cm"))
```


## DONE!
